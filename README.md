### Meshverse ðŸŒŒ

Enter the Meshverse, a world where users can create out of this world 3D meshes from ordingary 2d images.

## Overview ðŸš€ 

Our project allows users to either to upload a file from their computer or use their camera to create a 3D mesh using stable diffusion. The user can then download this mesh, add it as a stream into Speckle's client, or receive Speckle's data on the stream that they created. Some other features that we integrated includes google sign in via next-auth, a MongoDB database that stores image urls and user info data, the ability to view the gallary ( a collection of all other meshes generated by different users), and the ability to see what 3d meshes a specific user has generated.

## Features ðŸ’Ž 
- users can upload a file or use their camera to generate a 3d mesh
- users can sign up with their google accounts to save the 3d meshes that they created
- users can view a collection of all other 3d meshes created by other users
- users can add their generated 3d meshes directly into Speckle's Client
- users can download both the meshes that they created, and receive Speckle's API data on the meshes they created

## Setup 
1) Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/cerredz/Meshverse-Speckle-Hackathon
```
2) Create an image folder in the Flask backend
```
cd .\server\
mkdir images
```
3) Install all the neccessary Python dependencies (still in the server directory)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4) Create a .env file in the Server directory, and add your MongoDB connection string to the variable MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING
5) Traverse back to the root directory, and install all of the npm packages on the frontend
```
cd .\client\
npm i
```
6) go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ and create an 0-Auth 2.0 client id under api and services. then create a .env.local file in the client directory and add the client id and client secret to the varibales GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET. also, add a 64-lengthed random string to the SECRET variable, and your port you are running the frontend on in the NEXTAUTH_URL variable
7) Open a terminal window, and in the client directory run the following command
```
npm run dev
```
8) In another terminal tab, go to the server directory and run the following command
```
python server.py
```
9) Give it a few seconds and go to the port you are running your client on and have fun
