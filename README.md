### Meshverse ðŸŒŒ

Enter the Meshverse, a world where users can create out of this world 3D meshes from ordingary 2d images.

## Overview ðŸš€ 

Our project allows users to either to upload a file from their computer or use their camera to create a 3D mesh using stable diffusion. The user can then download this mesh, add it as a stream into Speckle's client, or receive Speckle's data on the stream that they created. Some other features that we integrated includes google sign in via next-auth, a MongoDB database that stores image urls and user info data, the ability to view the gallary ( a collection of all other meshes generated by different users), and the ability to see what 3d meshes a specific user has generated.

## Features ðŸ’Ž 
- users can upload a file or use their camera to generate a 3d mesh
- users can sign up with their google accounts to save the 3d meshes that they created
- users can view a collection of all other 3d meshes created by other users
- users can add their generated 3d meshes directly into Speckle's Client
- users can download both the meshes that they created, and receive Speckle's API data on the meshes they created
